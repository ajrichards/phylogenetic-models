phylogenetic-models
===================

A notebook for exploring phylogenetic models.  It is a notebook in the sense that literature and relevant models are studied, but it is also uses the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) to prototype models and ideas.

To learn more about these types of methods see the project by [Cam Davidson-Pilon.](http://www.camdp.com/) called [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/).
